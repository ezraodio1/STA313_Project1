Jake Thompson. The data comes from Genius and the Spotify API. The data set includes three .csv files: taylor_album_songs, taylor_all_songs, and taylor_albums. In our project, we only are only using the taylor_all_songs and taylor_albums data frames. This is because taylor_album_songs excludes singles releases and excludes the original releases of albums that now have a Taylor-owned alternative in support of artists wanting to own their own music; in our project, we wanted to include the original releases so we could compare them to the re-releases, and overall, provide a holistic analysis of Taylor Swift overtime. Additionally, this project uses the taylor_albums dataset - in order to have data about each albums as a whole.\n\nThis project seeks to investigate two questions: The first being: How do Taylor Swiftâ€™s single releases differ from the songs on the full albums? Second, we explore: How have Taylor Swiftâ€™s songs changed over time? The variables used to answer these questions are from the two .csv files mentioned above. From taylor_albums, we used : album_name (Album name), album_release (Album release date), metacritic_score (Metacritic score), and user_score (User score). From taylor_all_songs, we used : album_name (Album name), album_release (Album release date), single_release (Single release date), energy (Spotify energy score - a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 that represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity), valence (Spotify valence score from 0.0 to 1.0 - high valence sounds more positive, while low valence sounds more negative), and tempo (The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute). More information about the data sets can be found in the README file.\n\n## **Question 1**: How do Taylor Swiftâ€™s single releases differ from the songs on the full albums?\n\n### Introduction\n\nChoosing what songs to release as the singles before an album comes out is a key piece of strategy for any artist. The single should be a good representative of the album as a whole, should be very popular, and should leave the listener eager to hear the entire album. Many of Taylor Swift's most well known songs are her single releases, so we decided to see how her singles compare to the rest of her songs. We are interested to see if we can identify some components or aspects of songs that make them better candidates to be single releases, and in this way, we can understand Taylor Swift and her team's decision making process in a new way. To answer this question, we will use only the taylor_all_songs .csv file. Specifically, we will use the energy and tempo variables to compare single releases to album releases\n\n### Approach\n\nFor the first plot, we use a barplot (geom_col) to compare the energy levels of songs, faceted based on whether the songs came out on a single release or on the regular album release. We chose this plot because it is makes it easy to compare the single energy values to the regular album energy values. Additionally, it makes it easy enables the reader to compare the energy values of singles or from albums across all of Taylor Swift's releases. We thought this would be a great visualization strategy because of how easy these comparisons can be made. For example, we can see that, on average, the single releases from the album 1989 were .09 higher than that of the 1989 album. Also, we can see that the single releases of Fearless (Taylor's Version) and the single releases from the original Fearless have a difference of .15 in their energy score.\n\nFor the second plot, we use a Ridgeline plot (geom_density_ridges) to compare the tempo of songs released on an album versus as a single release. For this visualization, we chose a ridgeline plot because of the way it conveys the distribution of songs over the tempo range. With the two curves on the same plot, it makes it easy to see where they trend similarly and where they are different. This choice of ridgeline is great because it enables the reader to visualize how Taylor Swift's songs range in tempo based on their method of release.\n\n### Analysis\n\nLoad in Packages and Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nâ”€â”€ Attaching core tidyverse packages â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ tidyverse 2.0.0 â”€â”€\nâœ” dplyr     1.1.4     âœ” readr     2.1.5\nâœ” forcats   1.0.0     âœ” stringr   1.5.1\nâœ” ggplot2   3.5.0     âœ” tibble    3.2.1\nâœ” lubridate 1.9.3     âœ” tidyr     1.3.1\nâœ” purrr     1.0.2     \nâ”€â”€ Conflicts â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ tidyverse_conflicts() â”€â”€\nâœ– dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nâœ– dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nâ„¹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\ntaylor_all_songs <- readr::read_csv('data/taylor_all_songs.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\ntaylor_albums <- readr::read_csv('data/taylor_albums.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlot 1 (wrangle and plot)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntaylor_all_songs_including_singles <- taylor_all_songs |>\n  drop_na(album_name) |>\n  mutate(is_single = !(is.na(single_release)))\n\ntaylor_albums_energy <- taylor_all_songs_including_singles |>\n  drop_na(energy) |>\n  filter(is_single == FALSE) |>\n  group_by(album_name) |>\n  summarise(album_energy = mean(energy))\n\ntaylor_singles_energy <- taylor_all_songs_including_singles |>\n  drop_na(energy) |>\n  filter(is_single == TRUE) |>\n  group_by(album_name) |>\n  summarise(singles_energy = mean(energy))\n\n\nplot1a_data <- merge(taylor_albums_energy, taylor_singles_energy)\n\n\nplot1a_data <- plot1a_data |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"album_energy\", \"singles_energy\"),\n    names_to = \"song_type\",\n    values_to = \"energy\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    song_type = fct_recode(song_type, \"Album\" = \"album_energy\", \"Single\" = \"singles_energy\")\n  )\n\nplot1a_data <- plot1a_data |>\n  mutate(album_name = ifelse(album_name == \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\", \"Fearless (TV)\", album_name)) |>\n  mutate(album_name = factor(album_name, levels = c(\"Taylor Swift\", \"Fearless\", \n                                                    \"Fearless (TV)\",\n                                                    \"Speak Now\", \"Red\", \"1989\", \"reputation\",\n                                                    \"Lover\", \"folklore\", \"evermore\", \"Midnights\")))\n\n\nggplot(plot1a_data, aes(x = album_name, y = energy, fill = album_name)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(energy, 2)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~song_type) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#4497BA\", \"#BD9365\", \"#5F4A30\", \"#704073\",\n                               \"#982F47\", \"#7B96AF\", \"#0A0A0A\", \"#DEA9C9\",\n                               \"#4D4D4D\", \"#ACA38D\", \"#A26A5B\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Energy Values of Taylor Swift Albums Versus Single Releases\",\n    subtitle = \"Colored by Album\",\n    x = \"Albums\",\n    y = \"Energy\",\n    fill = \"Album\",\n    caption = \"Source: Tidy Tuesday Data\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/question1a-wrangle-and-plot-1.png){fig-alt='This figure is a bar chart titled \"Energy Values of Taylor\nSwift Albums Versus Single Releases\" that displays the energy of all\nof Taylor Swifts songs from each of her albums, compared to the singles\noff of each of those albums.

In fact, out of the 11 albums analyzed, only 2 albums have a lower average singles energy than average album-only-songs energy. Those albums are Taylor Swift and reputation. In fact, the difference between the average energy of singles and album-only songs was 0.07, meaning that the average energy of singles was 12.76 percent higher than the average energy of album-only songs.\n\nThe density ridgeline plot illustrates that the tempo of Taylor Swift's singles seem to be lower than the tempos of her album-only songs. This can be inferred from the fact that the plot for singles sits further to the left than the plot for the album-only songs. The plot for the singles is right-skewed, while the plot for the album-only songs is roughly symmetric. These observations made from looking at the plots are backed up by the data as well, as the average tempo for singles is 113.37 and the average tempo for album-only songs is 126.67.\n\n## **Question 2**: How have Taylor Swift's songs changed over time?\n\n### Introduction\n\nOne of the most incredible things about Taylor Swift is the longevity of her career and the evolution of her artist identity. She has created country music, pop music, folk music, etc. Additionally, she started her career at an notably young age. Her first album, Taylor Swift, came out in 2006 when the artist was merely 16 years old. Today, she is still making music. This sparked our interest in how her songs have changed overtime. Moreover, with Taylor's recent re-recordings, we wanted to look at how those re-recordings performed relative to the original recordings. We look at this question through two separate lenses: how has Taylor's literal music changed over time through attributes, such as energy and valence; and how Taylor's re-recordings of her albums vary in scores from critics and meta-scoring.\n\nTo do this, we used the taylor_all_songs and the taylor_albums .csv files. Specifically, we use the energy and valence variables from the taylor_all_songs data frame, and the user_score and metacritic_score from the taylor_albums data frame.\n\n### Approach\n\nFor plot 1, we overlaid a line graph (geom_line), a scatter plot (geom_point), and added a trend line (geom_smooth) to portray how the valence and energy have changed in Taylor Swift's music over time. We chose to do so with a line graph, with each point emphasized and a trend line - indicating the trajectory of her music overtime. This plot is particularly great for observing this trend because each point is clear, which album it is, and you can see clearly how each album compares to the others.\n\nFor plot 2, we used a bar graph (geom_col). In this plot, we wanted to address the differences in how Taylor Swift's re-releases scored relative to their original releases. We chose to do this with a faceted bar graph, because it makes very easy to compare the metacritic versus user scores. This is a very good plot to vizualize this data because the trends between Taylor's Version and the original Version are very accessible to the reader.\n\n### Analysis\n\nLoad in Packages and Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ntaylor_all_songs <- readr::read_csv('data/taylor_all_songs.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\ntaylor_albums <- readr::read_csv('data/taylor_albums.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlot 1 (wrangle and plot)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# the wrangle\ntaylor_albums_stats <- taylor_all_songs |>\n  drop_na(energy, valence) |>\n  group_by(album_name) |>\n  summarise(\n    album_energy = mean(energy),\n    album_valence = mean(valence)\n  )\n\nplot2a_data <- merge(taylor_albums, taylor_albums_stats)\n\nplot2a_data <- plot2a_data |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"album_energy\", \"album_valence\"),\n    names_to = \"song_attribute\",\n    values_to = \"attribute_value\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    song_attribute = fct_recode(song_attribute, \"energy\" = \"album_energy\", \"valence\" = \"album_valence\"),\n    album_name = factor(album_name, \n                        levels = c(\"Midnights\",  \"evermore\", \"folklore\",\n                                   \"Lover\", \"reputation\", \"1989\", \n                                   \"Red\", \"Speak Now\", \n                                   \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\", \n                                   \"Fearless\", \"Taylor Swift\", \n                                   \"The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection\",\n                                   \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"))\n  )\n\n\n\n#the plot\nggplot(plot2a_data, aes(x = album_release)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = attribute_value), color = \"#4D4D4D\", linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = attribute_value, color = album_name), size = 7, shape = 18) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(y = attribute_value), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"#E3183790\", size =2, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_label_repel(aes(y = attribute_value, label = album_name, fill = album_name), color = \"white\", size = 3, \n                   nudge_y = 0.1, nudge_x = 100) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0.0, 1.0, by = 0.1), limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#A26A5B\", \"#ACA38D\", \"#4D4D4D\", \"#DEA9C9\", \n                               \"#0A0A0A\", \"#7B96AF\", \"#982F47\", \"#704073\", \n                               \"#5F4A30\", \"#BD9365\", \"#4497BA\", \"#BA372E\", \"#903F31\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#A26A5B\", \"#ACA38D\", \"#4D4D4D\", \"#DEA9C9\", \n                               \"#0A0A0A\", \"#7B96AF\", \"#982F47\", \"#704073\", \n                               \"#5F4A30\", \"#BD9365\", \"#4497BA\", \"#BA372E\", \"#903F31\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Taylor Swift album attributes over time\",\n    x = \"Album Release Date\",\n    caption = \"Source: Tidy Tuesday Data\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -1, size = 12),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12)\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~song_attribute, ncol = 1, labeller = \n               labeller(song_attribute = c(energy = \"Attribute: Energy\", valence = \"Attribute: Valence\"))\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nâ„¹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/question2a-wrangle-and-plot-1.png){fig-alt='This figure is a point and line plot titled \"Taylor Swift album attributes over time\"\nthat displays the average energy and valence values of each Taylor swift album along\nthe date at which the album was released.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\nThe scatter plot indicates that the energy and valence scores of Taylor Swift's albums have not changed over time, despite the fact that she has been making music for over 16 years. While there are some differences between energy and valence scores for different albums, the general trend, as indicated by the line of best fit, has been no change.\n\nThe bar chart showing metacritic and user scores for albums that have both a Scooter version and Taylor version also allows us to make key insights about how Taylor Swift's songs have changed over time. Both the metacritic and user scores of the Taylor's version songs are higher than the those of the Scooter version songs. The average difference between metacritic scores is 11.5. The average difference between user scores is 5 .\n",
